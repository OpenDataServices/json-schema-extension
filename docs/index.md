# Open Data Services JSON Schema Extension

An extension to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) that adds keywords related to deprecation and codelists. It consists of JSON Schema metaschema patches and extended metaschemas for the following versions of JSON Schema:

```{toctree}
2020-12
draft-04
```

```{admonition} Deprecated keywords

Whilst the metaschemas reflect the recommended modelling approach, they include some deprecated keywords reflecting prior modelling approaches which may still be in use in some standards.
