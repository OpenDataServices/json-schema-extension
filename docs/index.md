# Open Data Services JSON Schema Extension

An extension to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to:

* Add keywords related to codelists
* Add keywords related to deprecation
* Disallow keywords not documented in either JSON Schema or the extension.

The extension consists of JSON Schema metaschema patches and extended metaschemas for the following versions of JSON Schema:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
2020-12
draft-04
```

```{admonition} Deprecated keywords

Whilst the metaschemas reflect the recommended modelling approach, they include some deprecated keywords reflecting prior modelling approaches which may still be in use in some standards.
